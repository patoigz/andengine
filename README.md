### AndEngine library - Contribution

## Donations
While updating AndEngine was a lot of fun, it also consumed many(!) days of my life. 

If you made profit using your game and can afford to spare a fraction of it, to one of the maintainer developer of the game engine you used.
I would be very grateful! =)
